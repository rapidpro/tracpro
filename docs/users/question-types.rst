Question types
==============

TracPro questions are classified as either categorical or open-ended. Question
type is determined by how the flow variable is set up on RapidPro.

Open-ended questions
--------------------

To set up an open-ended question, do not change the default choices in the
"If the message response..." section on RapidPro.
